            <p class='about-p-text'>
                I grew up in a small town called Shakopee in Minnesota.  I've moved around a bit over the years, but I eventually came back to Shakopee and live here now.  Growing up I was really into sports.  I played football, basketball, and baseball.  <br/><br/>

                At my last job I worked in IT for amazon for 7 years.  I am currently interested in changing focus to development and so I am now studying web development.
